Employee-Listing-App-with-angular.js
====================================

This is the first version of a basic employee listing app built using angular.js and twitter bootstrap. 
Back-end i used for storing and retrieving data is written using PHP and MYSQL.
However, in coming future, i'll shift it to node.js and MongoDB.
You are free to use this app for learning purpose or even for your professional project.
I apologize if you don't find a quality code in the app as i am a beginner.
Feel free to contribute your knowledge and enhance this app.
So that it can help other beginners to learn angular.js.
Any suggestions for improvement are most welcome!!!
